This is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, the best discovery I made this year.

The main objective here was to practice using the tools taught until this point at the fundamentals, mainly the "html boiler plate", the fundamentals of a html file.
As the task required, I made 4 pages in total: the index, my main page, and three more destined for the recipes themselves; were they a Lasagna, as suggested by the own Odin, a Burger, and a Cheese Bread. 



P.S.: I ask you to please not replicate this recipes; not that I don't trust in my cooking abilities, it is just I did not give much atention to the content in itself.

P.S.2: I am now revisiting this project after a while. It is nice to see that my personal development is helping me with the tasks presented on 'TOP'; not that I studied programming while distant from it, but the way I perceive things changed my approach to them. Glad to see that at least my English skills improved.
