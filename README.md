This is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, the best discovery I made this year.

The main objective here was to practice using the tools taught until this point at the fundamentals, mainly the "html boiler plate", the fundamentals of a html file.
As the task required, I made 4 pages in total: the index, my main page, and three more destined for the recipes themselves; were they a Lasagna, as suggested by the own Odin, a Burger, and a Cheese Bread. 



P.S.: I ask you to please not replicate this recipes; not that I don't trust in my cooking abilities, it is just I did not give much atention to the content in itself.
