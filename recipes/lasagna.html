        <p>A long time ago, in the Roman Empire, some very creative people thought of cooking some pasta and vegetables cubes all together and end up creating one of the most popular dishes worldwide, the Lasagna. Everything in the world is affected by its surrounding and it would not be different with food (to be honest, they may even be specially affected); people started putting meat in it, sometimes chicken, cheese, different types of sauce, pepper, and lots of other different ingredients.</p>
        <p>As soon as it starts spreading to farther lands, people tend to change it a little bit more as they please and now we have the peak of the Lasagna's evolutionary process: the Brazagna</p>
        <h2><strong>Here are the ingredients you will need:</strong></h2>
        <ul><strong>    
            <li>One packet of pre-cooked Lasagna Sheets;</li>
            <li>500g of sliced ham;</li>
            <li>500g of mozzarela cheese;</li>
            <li>500g of ground meat;</li>
            <li>One packet of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Oregano to taste</li>
        </strong></ul>
        <h2><strong>Directions:</strong></h2>
        <ol><strong>
            <li>Cook the ground meat</li>
            <li>When the ground meat is ready, add the tomato sauce, salt, and spices to taste</li>
            <li>Star mouting the Brazagna with the meat, then the lasagna sheets, then the mozzarela and last the ham</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until it is done</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 180ºC</li>
            <li>At last, let it roast from 20 to 30 minutes</li>
        </strong></ol>
        <h4>And "voilà", your Brazagna is ready</h4>
